<br />

This is a React Native app clone of Cabify that uses Tailwind CSS and React Native Navigation libraries. The app provides similar features as Cabify such as booking a ride, tracking the ride, and payment processing. It also uses Google Maps to provide location-based services. However, due to the paid Google API key, the project has not been completed yet.

This project is ideal for React Native developers who are interested in building a ride-sharing app using popular libraries and tools. The project is open-source, so developers can contribute to it and learn from it.

## Features
* User authentication and registration
* User profile management
* Booking a ride
* Tracking the ride
* Payment processing
* Integration with Google Maps

## Technologies Used
* React Native
* Tailwind CSS
* React Native Navigation
* Google Maps API

### Creating a Build

- Optimize the assets for speed - `npx expo-optimize` (formerly expo optimize)
- Bundle the project for production - `npx expo export:web` (`expo build:web` in the legacy Expo CLI).
- Creates a production ready static bundle in the `web-build/` directory. Don't edit this folder directly.
- If you make any changes to your project, you'll need to re-build for production.
- For more help use `npx expo export:web --help`
